## Tableau Visualisations (Tableau visualisation practice)

This repository is to showcase how I have leveraged Tableau as my main data visualisation tools for one of the units that I took back in university days. The repo would consist of 2 folders for 2 data visulisation assignments that I performed, both of which were given top marks among the class. One of the assignments also used TabuVis, which is an interactive visualisation tool for tabular data created by Dr. Quang Vinh Nguyen. You can learn more about the tool [here].(https://sourceforge.net/projects/tabuvis/)

### Assignment 1:
Consisting of 2 dataset that I used to illustrate different graphing techniques (1 university internal dataset + 1 external dataset)
- Interal dataset: The structure of programs and courses offered at Western Sydney University (visualised with TabuViz)
- External dataset: Summer Olympics Medalists from 1896 to 2008 dataset from Tableau Public Dataset

### Assignment 2:
This assigment requires a bit more data cleaning before visualisation. We used UNION syntax to merge observations from 2010 to 2020. Our scope of exploration included:
- Analysis of airports performance with Treemap and geographic visualisation
- Airports’ performance through the years via time series visualisations
- Airports’ performance through 12 months of a selected year
- Airlines’ performance via Parallel Coordinates Plot
- Flight efficiency of the routes and the airlines

Please find the PDF files for those two assignments for visual contents.
